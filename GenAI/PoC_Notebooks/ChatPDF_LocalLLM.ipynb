After review it shall be \\nat the discretion of the stewards to decide whether or not to proceed with an \\ninvestigation.  \\n The stewards may also investigate an Incident noted by themselves.  \\n54.2 a) It shall be at the discretion of the stewards to decide if any driver involved in an \\nIncident should be penalised.  \\n  Unless it is clear to the stewards that a driver was wholly or predominantly to blame \\nfor an Incident no penalty will be imposed.  \\n b) If an Incident is under investigation by the stewards a message informing all \\nCompetitors which driver or drivers are involved will be sent using the official \\nmessaging system.  \\ni) Provided that such a m essage is displayed no later than sixty ( 60) minutes \\nafter the sprint session or the race has finished the driver or drivers \\nconcerned may not leave the circuit without the consent of the stewards.  \\n54.3 The stewards may impose any one of the penalties below on any driver involved in an \\nIncident:  \\n a) A five (5) second time penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane, stop in his pit \\nstop position for at least five seconds and then re -join the sprint session or the \\nrace. The relevant driver may however elect not to stop, provided he carries out no \\nfurther pit stop before the end of the sprint session or the race. In such cases five \\n(5) seconds will be added to the elapsed the sprint session or race time of the \\ndriver concerned.  \\n b) A ten (10) second time penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane, stop in his pit \\nstop position for at least ten seconds and then re -join the sprint session or the race. \\nThe relevant driver may however elect not to stop, provided he carries out no \\nfurther pit stop bef ore the end of the sprint session or the race. In such cases ten  \\n(10) seconds will be added to the elapsed the sprint session or race time of the \\ndriver concerned.  \\n In both of the above cases the driver concerned must carry out the penalty the next time \\nhe enters the pit lane and, for the avoidance of doubt, this includes any stop the driver \\nmakes whilst a VSC or safety car procedure is in use.  \\n c) A drive -through penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane and re -join the sprint \\nsession or the race without stopping.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../Data/F1RuleBook.pdf', 'page': 57}, page_content='2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations  58/107 30 September  2022 \\n©202 2 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile   Issue 2 \\n  d) A ten second stop -and-go time penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane, stop in \\nhis pit stop position for at least ten seconds and then re -join the sprint session or  \\nthe race.  \\n If any of the four  (4) penalties above are imposed upo n a driver, and that driver is unable \\nto serve the penalty due to retirement from the sprint session or the race, the stewards \\nmay impose a grid place penalty on the driver at his next race. \\n If any of the four (4) penalties above are imposed during the last three  (3) laps, or after \\nthe end of a sprint session or a race, Article  54.4b) below will not apply and five seconds \\nwill be added to the elapsed time of the driver concerned in the case of (a) above, 10 \\nseconds in the case of (b), 20 seconds in the c ase of (c) and 30 seconds in the case of \\n(d). \\n e) A time penalty.  \\n f) A reprimand.  \\n g) A drop of any number of grid positions at the driver’s next race. \\n If any of the seven penalties above are imposed they shall not be subject to appeal.  \\n h) Disqualification  from the results.  \\n i) Suspension from the driver’s next Competition . \\n54.4 Should the stewards decide to impose any of the penalties under Article  54.3a), 54.3b), \\n54.3c) or 54.3d), the following procedure will be followed:  \\n a) The stewards will give written notification of the penalty which has been imposed \\nto the Competitor concerned and will  inform all Competitors using  the official \\nmessaging system.  \\n b) With the exception of Articles  54.3a) and 54.3b) above, from the time the \\nCompetitor concerned is notified of the stewards’ decision using the official \\nmessaging system the relevant driver may cross the Line on the track no more \\nthan twice before entering the pit lane and, in the case of a penalty  in accordance \\nwith Article  54.3d), proceeding to his pit stop position where he shall remain for the \\nperiod of the time penalty.  \\n  However, unless the driver was already in the pit entry for the purpose of serving \\nhis penalty, he may not carry out the penalty  if the VSC procedure is in use or after \\nthe safety car has been deployed. The number of times the driver crosses the Line \\nbehind the safety car or during the VSC procedure will be added to the maximum \\nnumber of times he may cross the Line on the track.  \\n c) Whilst a car is stationary in the pit lane as a result of incurring a penalty  in \\naccordance with Articles  54.3a) or 54.3b) above , it may not be worked on until the \\ncar has been stationary for the duration of the penalty.  \\n d) Whilst a car is stationary in the pit lane as a result of incurring a time penalty  in \\naccordance with Article  54.3d) above it may not be worked on. However, if the \\nengine stops any work necessary to re -start it may be carried out after the time \\npenalty period has elapsed.  If the Competitor is unable to start the engine the car \\nmay then only be worked on in the driver’s garage.  \\n e) Any breach or failure to comply with Articles  54.4b), 54.4c) or 54.4d) may result in \\nthe car being disqualified.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../Data/F1RuleBook.pdf', 'page': 58}, page_content='2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations  59/107 30 September  2022 \\n©202 2 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile   Issue 2 \\n 55) SAFETY CAR  \\n55.1 The FIA safety car will be driven by an FIA appointed safety car driver and will carry an \\nFIA safety car observer capable of recognising all the competing cars who is in \\npermanent radio contact with race control . \\n55.2 Prior to the pit lane opening for a reconnaissance lap, the safety car will leave the pit \\nlane and take up position at the front of the grid and remain there until the five  (5) minute \\nsignal is given.

This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the track, \\nthe pit entr y or the pit lane.  \\n55.6 The safety car will join the track with its orange lights illuminated and will do so regardless \\nof where the leader is.  \\n55.7 All competing cars must reduce speed and form up in line behind the safety car no more \\nthan ten car lengths  apart. In order to ensure that drivers reduce speed sufficiently, from \\nthe time at which all Competitors have been sent the “SAFETY CAR DEPLOYED” \\nmessage  using the official messaging system until the time that each car crosses the \\nfirst safety car line for the second time, drivers must stay above the minimum time set by \\nthe FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling sector and at both the first and second \\nsafety car lines (a marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of \\nthe FI A light panels).  \\n The stewards may impose either of the penalties under Article 54.3a), 54.3b), 54.3c) or \\n54.3d) on any driver who fails to stay above the minimum time as required by the above.  \\n55.8 With the exception of the cases listed under a) to h) bel ow, no driver may overtake \\nanother car on the track, including the safety car, until he passes the Line (see Article \\n5.3) for the first time after the safety car has returned to the pits.  \\n The exceptions are:  \\n a) If a driver is signalled to do so from the safety car.  \\n b) Under Articles  49.6, 55.13, 58.6 , and 58.12 . \\n c) When entering the pits a driver may pass another car remaining on the track, \\nincluding the safety car, after he has reached the first safety car line.  \\n d) When leaving the pits a driver m ay overtake, or be overtaken by, another car on \\nthe track before he reaches the second safety car line.  \\n e) When the safety car is returning to the pits it may be overtaken by cars on the track \\nonce it has reached the first safety car line.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../Data/F1RuleBook.pdf', 'page': 59}, page_content='2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations  60/107 30 September  2022 \\n©202 2 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile   Issue 2 \\n  f) Whilst in t he pit entry, pit lane or pit exit a driver may overtake another car which \\nis also in one of these three areas.  \\n g) Any car stopping in its designated garage area whilst the safety c ar is using the pit \\nlane (see Article 55.11 below) may be overtaken.  \\n h) If any car slows with an obvious problem.  \\n55.9 When ordered to do so by the clerk of the course the observer in the car will use a green \\nlight to signal to any cars between it and the leader that they should pass. These cars \\nwill continue at  reduced speed and without overtaking until they reach the line of cars \\nbehind the safety car.  \\n55.10 Except under Article  55.12 below, the safety car shall be used at least until the leader is \\nbehind it and all remaining cars are lined up behind him.  \\n Once behind the safety car, the leader must keep within ten (10) car lengths of it (except \\nunder Article  55.13 below).  \\n55.11 Under certain circumstances the clerk of the course may ask the cars and the safety car \\nto use the pit lane.

Restricted Aerodynamic testing is the testing by a Competitor or any Associate of \\na Competitor and/or by any contracted party of a Competitor or of any Associate \\nof a Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of a Competitor or for its \\nown purpos es and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor \\nin a test environment or numerical simulation of a representation of an F1 car or \\nsub-component in order to measure, observe or infer any forces, displacements, \\npressures or air flow dir ection resulting directly or indirectly from the incident air \\nflow. \\nb. A three -dimensional representation of an F1 car or sub -component subject to \\nRestricted Aerodynamic testing, defined either physically or digitally, will be \\nconsidered for the purposes of this Article as a Restricted Aerodynamic Test \\nGeometry (RATG) and save for where specifically permitted by this Article may not \\nbe added to, removed from, morphed or modified. In order to prevent Restricted \\nAerodynamic testing methodologies int ended to subvert any limits on the number \\nor nature of RATGs permitted under the ATR the following will apply:  \\ni. The purpose of a RATG is to allow aerodynamic assessment of a single new \\ngeometry, with aerodynamic dependency maintained throughout the \\nsimulate d flow field. Any attempt to derive aerodynamically independent \\nresults for subcomponents of a RATG, either in the initial simulation or test, \\nor by subsequent modification to the simulation or test conditions, is not \\npermitted. Any attempt to use boundary  conditions or similar to infer the \\neffect of combining RATGs, without accruing a further RATG, is also not \\npermitted. The use of boundary conditions cannot be exploited to simulate \\nthe effect on the fluid of a geometry which is different from the RATG in use. \\nii. If the representation contains external bodywork surfaces on both sides of \\nthe centre plane of the car these must be symmetrical about this plane with \\nthe exception of the wheel bodywork defined by Article 3.13 of the Technical \\nRegulations. Minimal  exceptions for parts directly associated with the cooling \\nof the power unit, or changes of car attitude allowed under section 3d (roll \\nand steer) will be permitted.  \\niii. Excluding permitted degrees of freedom for RWTT and changes in RCFDs, \\nthe substitution or rep lacement of any part of a RATG with a non -F1 car \\ngeometry, or the placement of any physical or computational boundary \\ncondition or solver setting, that simulates or attempts to simulate a \\nmodification to this RATG will be considered as a new RATG.   \\niv. Section s (or sub -models) of a RATG which is used for RCFDs may be \\ncreated by removing geometry from the parent RATG and placing boundary'), Document(metadata={'source': '../Data/F1RuleBook.pdf', 'page': 85}, page_content='2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations  86/107 30 September  2022 \\n©202 2 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile   Issue 2 \\n conditions of velocity or pressure profiles generated entirely from the same \\nRATG to replicate the flow field resulting from t he geometry that has been \\nremoved. This will not be considered as a new RATG provided any geometry \\nwithin the section is identical to the parent RATG. Exceptionally where \\ndownstream portions of the RATG are removed these may be replaced with \\na single geome try approved for this purpose by the FIA.  \\nv. Sections (or sub -models) of a RATG used for RCFDs and created by \\nremoving geometry from a parent RATG may not be subsequently \\ngeometrically modified without being considered as a new RATG. Any \\nboundary conditions o f velocity or pressure profiles added in the process of \\ncreating the section (or sub -model) and used to replicate the flow field \\nresulting from the geometry that has been removed may not be changed to \\nboundary condition or profiles other than those generat ed from the parent \\nRATG without being considered a new RATG.  \\nvi. If the representation contains surfaces that represent components of more \\nthan one F1 car then it shall be construed as the equivalent number of \\nRATGs. Excluding permitted degrees of freedom for RWTT and changes in \\nRCFDs, any subsequent modification of the relative position of the \\nrepresentations of F1 cars will be considered as new RATGs equivalent to \\nthe number of F1 car representations.  \\nvii. A baseline RATG is defined as a reference chosen from time  to time that \\nserves for comparison purposes.  \\nc. An Aerodynamic Testing Period (ATP) is a period of consecutive calendar weeks \\nfor the purposes of evaluation of the limits within this Article.  As soon as one ATP \\nends a new one begins, with no gaps between th em. \\nThere will be 6 ATPs in any year. The dates of these periods will be as follows:  \\ni. Period 1 will start on 1 January and finish at the end of week 9.  \\nii. Periods 2, 3 and 5 will run for exactly 8 weeks each.  \\niii. Period 4 will run for 10 weeks, comprising the Summer Factory Shutdown \\ndescribed in Article 2 4.1. \\niv. Period 6 will end on the 31 December.  \\nFor the above definition, weeks are assumed to start on a Monday and week 1 is \\nthe first week of four days or more in the calendar year.  \\nIn exceptional circumstances the FIA may revise these ATP at its absolute \\ndiscretion in accordance with changes or events likely to affect these restrictions.  \\nd. In the context of this Article the words bodywork  and sprung suspension will have \\nthe same definition as those p rovided by Article 3 and Article 10  of the  Technical \\nRegulations.  \\nAny data acquired during Restricted Aerodynamic testing may only be available to \\nthe Competitor that acquired it through use of the restricted aerodynamic testing \\navailable to it in accordance with the limits in this Article.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../Data/F1RuleBook.pdf', 'page': 86}, page_content='2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations  87/107 30 September  2022 \\n©202 2 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile   Issue 2 \\n  \\n \\n2 Restricted Wind Tunnel Testing (RWTT)  \\nRWTT may only be carried out in wind tunnels which have been nominated by the \\nCompetitor to the FIA. Each Competitor may nominate only one wind tunnel for use in \\nany one  twelve month period and declare it in writing to the FIA. For a new entrant, the \\nnomination must be made no later than 7 days after the date on which it officially \\nbecomes a Competitor. No re -nominations may be made for at least 12 months. \\nNominations sho uld include the facility location, unique identification of the wind tunnel \\nand the scale of model and RATG to be used. The FIA will consider, at its absolute \\ndiscretion, earlier or temporary nominations if a wind tunnel already nominated by a \\nCompetitor s uffers a long term failure or for the purpose of evaluating alternative wind \\ntunnels. If a different facility is to be used or if the existing facility is changed or upgraded, \\nother than for routine maintenance or replacement, then a new declaration must b e \\nsubmitted to the FIA within one month of the change or at the time of submission of a \\ntesting period report whichever is earlier.  \\n For the avoidance of doubt, any RWTT carried out on behalf of or for the benefit of the \\nCompetitor  by an Associate, a contracted party of the Competitor or of any Associate of \\nthe Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of the Competitor or for its own \\npurposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor must take \\nplace in the wind tunne l nominated by the Competitor.  \\na. The limits for RWTT will be the number of runs of RWTT, the amount of wind tunnel \\noccupancy time and wind tunnel wind -on time.  \\ni. During RWTT a single run will be deemed to commence each time the wind \\ntunnel air speed rises above 5m/s and will end the first time thereafter it falls \\nbelow 5m/s.  \\nii. During RWTT, once the wind tunnel air speed rises above 5m/s the RATG \\nmust remain fixed an d unmodified until the wind tunnel air speed returns \\nbelow 1m/s.  \\niii. Between runs of RWTT  detail changes to the RATG and  model are \\npermitted.  \\nb. Wind on time is defined as the amount of time in hours summed over the ATP , \\nwhere the wind tunnel air speed exceeds 1 5m/s for RWTT.  \\nc. During RWTT, the first shift of occupancy will be deemed to commence the first \\ntime the wind tunnel air speed is above 5m/s on a given calendar day, and will end \\nat a time, declared by the Competitor , when the wind tunnel air speed falls be low \\n5m/s on the same calendar day. A second shift of occupancy will be deemed to \\ncommence the first time the wind tunnel air speed is above 5m/s following the end \\nof the first shift of occupancy (on the same calendar day) and will end, either when \\nthe wind  tunnel air speed falls below 5m/s for the last time on the same calendar \\nday or, at the end of the calendar day in the event a run is still in progress. Only \\ntwo shifts of occupancy may be carried out in any one calendar day.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../Data/F1RuleBook.pdf', 'page': 87}, page_content='2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations  88/107 30 September  2022 \\n©202 2 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile   Issue 2 \\n d.  In the event of a demonstrat ed wind tunnel failure or other Force Majeure the FIA \\nwill consider, at its absolute discretion, permitting additional occupancy to be used \\nto compensate for that which is lost as a result.  \\ne. For the avoidance of doubt any RWTT performed for the Competitor  by any \\nAssociate of the Competitor  and/or by any contracted party of the Competitor  or of \\nany Associate of the Competitor  or any external entity working on behalf of the \\nCompetitor  or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its \\nwork t o the Competitor  during an ATP will be subject to these same limits as if the \\ntests were performed by the Competitor . \\n3 RWTT Permitted technology  \\nThe following restrictions apply during RWTT:  \\na. Only wind tunnels that use air at atmospheric pressure as the test fluid are \\npermitted. Other than rotations of the RATG and model or ground plane about the \\nyaw axis, designs which attempt to create curved flow conditions relative to the \\nRATG are not permitted. For closed section wind tunnels adaption of vertical wal ls \\nand the ceiling to improve air flow uniformity is permitted.  \\nb. No RWTT may be carried out using a scale model and RATG which is greater than \\n60% of full size neither may it be carried out at a wind tunnel air speed exceeding \\n50m/s measured relative to the  scale model and RATG.  Furthermore, during \\nrestricted wind tunnel testing the magnitude of the rate of change of the wind tunnel \\nair speed measured relative to the scale model and RATG  must be less than \\n4.5m/s². The rate of change of the wind tunnel air sp eed will be defined as the \\nderivative of wind tunnel air speed and smoothed using a moving average filter, \\ncentred on each sample, of period 0.5 seconds during each wind tunnel air speed \\nramp up and ramp down phase. These phases are defined as the periods when \\nthe wind tunnel air speed is varying between 15m/s and 95% of the maximum wind \\ntunnel air speed during a run.  \\nc. Only one model and RATG  may be used per run. A maximum of two models may \\nbe used and a single model change made per Competitor per 24 hour period. For \\nthe avoidance of doubt, a model in this context is defined by its underlying spine, \\nmotors and sensors.  \\nd. The only permitted degre es of freedom of the model and RATG during a run of \\nRWTT are:  \\ni. Wheel rotation about the wheel axis  \\nii. Changes of ride height and roll angle relative to the ground plane and \\nassociated articulation of the elements representing the RATG suspension  \\niii. Changes of load applied to wheels through the elements representing the \\nRATG suspension  \\niv. Steering of the front wheels  \\nv. Changes of yaw angle relative to the incident air flow and/or ground plane  \\nvi. Simulation of differing exhaust flow  \\nvii. Adjustment of the flap angl e of the front wing'), Document(metadata={'source': '../Data/F1RuleBook.pdf', 'page': 88}, page_content='2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations  89/107 30 September  2022 \\n©202 2 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile   Issue 2 \\n viii. Adjustment of the incidence of the rearmost and uppermost element of the \\ntop rear wing  \\nix. Adjustment or operation of sensors  \\ne. Changes of attitude of the model and RATG may not occur at a rate that requires \\nchanges of ride height  at the fron t or rear axle centreline greater than  the scale \\nequivalent of 0.033 m/s on the full size F1 car and/or rotation about the yaw or roll \\naxes at a rate greater than 1.0 deg./s.  \\nf. Where non -rigid wind tunnel tyres are used for RWTT these may only be produced \\nby the appointed tyre supplier. Furthermore, devices that actively modify the shape \\nof the tyre during RWTT other than as a result of vertical and lateral loads reacted \\nat the contact patch are not permitted. Tyre pressure control is permitted but the \\ncomple te wheel must contain only a single fixed internal gas volume.  \\n4 Restricted CFD (RCFD) simulations  \\nRCFDs are Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations by a Competitor or any \\nAssociate of a Competitor and/or by any contracted party of a Competitor or of any \\nAssociate of a Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of a Competitor or for \\nits own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor of \\nflows that are gaseous in the case of a F1 car and are not  classified as power unit \\nsimulations. Any simulation of flows contained within the power unit cooling or lubrication \\nsystems, air, air/fuel mixtures, combustion process or products of combustion from a \\nboundary commencing at the power unit’s atmospheric a ir intake ducts, passing through \\nthe power unit and finishing at the exit of the exhaust system will be classified as a power \\nunit simulation.  \\nFor the avoidance of doubt, if any CFD simulation (other than the power unit simulation \\ndefined above) reveals in formation to a Competitor or to an Associate of the Competitor \\nwhether directly, via a contracted party or via an external entity working on behalf of a \\nCompetitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to \\na Competitor, about flows that are gaseous on a F1 car then it is a RCFD simulation. For \\nexample, any CFD simulations conducted at scales other than 1:1 or using non -gaseous \\nfluids are still RCFDs as they reveal information about flows that are gaseous on the full \\nsize F1 car.  \\na. A RCFDs refers to the pre -processing, the solver part or parts of the simulation \\nprocess, and the post processing of the results of the simulation.  \\ni. Pre-processing refers to the meshing, decomposition and setup of the \\nsimulation.  \\nii. Solver refers to the program or programs that compute the solution of the \\nequations describing the flow including any extension of the simulation or \\nsimulations involving additional numerical computation (for example but not \\nlimited, to adjoint computation).  \\niii.
